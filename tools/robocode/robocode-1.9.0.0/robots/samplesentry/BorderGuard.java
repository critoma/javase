/**
 * BorderGuard - is a sample robot that demonstrates how the BorderSentry interface can be used for
 * creating a robot that guards the border area of the battle field, and which is efficient against
 * robots trying to hide at corners and robots sneaking around near the borders.
 * <p>
 * This robot is somewhat advanced due to:<br>
 * 1) it uses linear targeting for predicting how to hit robots that moves in straight lines.<br>
 * 2) it will only fire at a robot, if it figures out that its bullets will do damage to that
 * particular robot, e.g. when the robots predicted future position will be within the sentry border
 * attack range.<br>
 * 3) it has an efficient scanner that keeps the scan angle as little as possible to get as new
 * scanned data for enemy robots as possible.<br>
 * 4) it picks a target robot to fire at, which is the nearest robot our robot will be able to
 * damage (by predicting its future position using linear targeting).<br>
 * 5) it only moves along the borders of the battle field and constantly changes its direction, so
 * it is not an easy target, and it will try to get as close to its target robot as possible.<br>
 * <p>
 * Lots of improvements can be made to this robot by copying it - making it even stronger. The
 * intention with of this sample robot is to serve as a more advanced example of how a AdvancedRobot
 * can be made, and how it can be structured as most sample robots are far simpler.

 * This robot makes use of the Oldest Scanned melee scanner from the RoboWiki:<br>
